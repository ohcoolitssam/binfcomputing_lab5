BINF 2111 - Intro to Bioinformatics Computing; made two scripts, one script that houses a function that intakes a string and then counts the amount of M's, R's, Y's, and L's, as well as change the L's to lowercase, followed by returning a modified string and a percentage of the sequence via the counted letters, and the second script just intakes a .faa file, apply the aaCount function from the other script and then print the outputs; done in Python and VIM.
